# Menu Plan Service	
A super simple implementation of a service taking advantage of the [Menu Plan](http://menuplan.app) webhoooks function.  
Using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), my tool of choice for simple services.  

The service has two endpoints, where you can POST a JSON and then GET an HTML.

- plan
- shopping_list

Be sure to make the directory writable, the or modify the script to write the JSON somewhere else.

If you're wondering what Menu Plan is, check the [Support website](http://menuplan.app).
